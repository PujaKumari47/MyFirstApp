 *
 *  To start the service, simply call `startOnPort:` with a port number that you wish to enable the
 *  `hublive` application to connect on (the same port should then be supplied when starting `hublive`).
 *  The service will then call its delegate once it has created a view controller for any JSON data that
 *  was passed from `hublive`.
 *
 *  You don't implement this protocol yourself, instead the Hub Framework contains an implementation of it.
 *  Note though that this implementation is only compiled when the application hosting the framework is
 *  compiled for DEBUG.
