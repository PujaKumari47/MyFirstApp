/**
 *  Protocol used to define Hub Framework actions
 *
 *  Actions are independant pieces of code that can be executed in response to events, such as selection,
 *  other user interface events, timers, etc. They can be used to implement application-wide extensions
 *  to the Hub Framework and handle tasks like model mutations, user interface updates, etc. Actions are
 *  either performed automatically by the Hub Framework when a component was selected, or by a component
 *  conforming to the `HUBComponentActionPerformer` protocol.
 *
 *  Actions are created by an implementation of `HUBActionFactory`, which are registered for a certain
 *  namespace with `HUBActionRegistry`.
